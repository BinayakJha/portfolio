        projectTitle: "Blood Donation Website (Beta)",
        projectDescription: "I've been leading a project called Blood Donors Nepal. The primary goal of this project is to digitalize the blood donation system in Nepal. People who are in need of a specific blood group may not be able to find it in blood banks, so they post it on Facebook, where they have a slim chance of getting what they want. The situation is heartbreaking, and several people have lost their lives as a result of it. I began working on this project with the goal of lowering the number of deaths caused by a lack of blood at the appropriate time. It will create a direct connection between blood donors and those in need of blood. When people keep their blood requests, people with the same blood group or a matching blood group are notified. As a result, once the donor accepts the request, the patient will be able to contact the donor via the website or by sharing contact information. I will not monetize this website and will continue to work on it until it is fully automated. I'm also planning to contact blood banks across the country. \n \n I plan to collaborate with Hamro LifeBank, and Blood Donors Association Nepal, and get more users to come and register on this website. This app already has a prototype and I am working on publishing it.",

        projectDescription: "I have been leading my own small-scale e-startup called Gyan-e. I’m working there as a Lead Front-end Engineer/ Web-Developer/Designer and Project Manager. Gyan-e is a Q/A platform specially designed for students who want suggestions not only about their subjects but also about life in General. I am leading a team of five, and I conduct daily meetings with them to talk about the user experience, and user retention and devise ways to make the website more impactful in the lives of students.\n  Gyan-e is already a community of 500+ active students. The topics of discussion on the website range from simple math problems to students talking about their life problems, and the students supporting them to solve them. Besides that, there are subject experts who have shared study notes, and explanation videos related to their respective fields. Gyan-e is being made better day after day, and its goal and visions are totally different than other Q/A forums. It was built in order to enhance academic performances, through the dissemination of various course notes and academic resources to students, reducing the gaps in education, and fostering their self-learning processes under their fingertips. Gyan-e has been presented as an effective solution for many students.",

        projectDescription: "During the time frame as COVID-19 was increasing rapidly, graduates from Harvard and Princeton university approached me to work as their junior backend developer. I remember not sleeping for two days straight and making the website live of Covid Resource Nepal. I worked with a front-end engineer of MIT, and we debugged codes together. \n Within a short duration, the project gathered $20000+ funds through Go Fund Me to buy oxygen cylinders for Nepal. The website still contains resources for anyone who’s suffering from Covid, and it will assist them with all the resources they need weather they need help with raising money, contacting doctors, or get oxygen cylinders. This Website has already collected funds and has helped more than 10000 Covid affected families by providing them all kinds of resources needed",
